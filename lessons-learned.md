# Lessons learned
We want to get better. Let's document what worked and what not after each event so we can improve for next time.

## January
- Women didn’t come. Need to fix that.
- Beginners didn’t feel welcome. Need to create a nurturing feeling and encourage.
- Music?

## February
- No more organizing an event and leading a project by the same person
- Getting ready with issues and verify that installation runs clean is super important
- If there are a lot of people in a project, there should be a channel of communication between them (so they can collaborate and not step over each other)
- Feedback after the event is a must (from both project leads and participants)
- People want to know the list of projects in advance.
