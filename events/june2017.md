# Goodness Squad - June 2017
Listed bellow are the projects participating in this event.
If you are attending, please take time prior to the event to choose a project and set up a local development environment.
At the event there will be brief presentations of the projects (1 minutes per project), and you will be able to choose the project you wish to contribute to,
but getting ready before the event will save you time during the event. So if there are several interesting projects, you may choose to set up a local environment
for all of them.

[Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/goodness-squad/vscode)


### 4. Slim.js 

git repository: https://github.com/eavichay/slim.js
fork if you wish to contribute

requirements:
node 6.9.5 and up (+npm)
chrome
java (for running the selenium tests)
intellij is recommended for static serving of test pages, if you use other ide than you will need some static http server, either install python or some js based static server (npm's server-static will do good also)
if you choose the python way the cli to start static server will be:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

things to work on - choose by what you expect from this meeting:
1. FOR FUN: enriching demo library (webco: https://github.com/eavichay/webco)
2. FOR DEV: performance for repeaters
3. FOR LEARNING: demo dashboard application based on slim.js
4. FOR DEBUGGER GUYS: POC for version 3. Currently the next-gen slim 3 is half the size of slim 2 but it's too slow to be a candidate
