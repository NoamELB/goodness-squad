The goodness squad line of events is a community effort to do good and meet one another through open source contribution. We meet once a month for a festive evening of coding and FTF interaction. Yey!

More info can be found about it [in this post](https://hackernoon.com/goodness-squad-a8704d594a7a).

## What's in this repo
We'd like to document the process of organizing the events. We believe in transparency, and whoever wishes to organize their own line of coding events might find the information here useful.
This also serves for having the resources available for our own team of organizers, who voluntarily spend time to make the events with the best quality and as fun as possible.
