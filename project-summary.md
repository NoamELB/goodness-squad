# Project Summary
At the end of every event, we like to pause and hear what goodness each project had. We do this with a **1 minute** summary given by each project lead.

Every project lead should collect a bit of data during the event about what was done. Hopefully all related issues were tagged with #goodnessSquad so that's also a way to know what was going on.

To assist in data collection, and to provide a general direction, here are the things worth mentioning.
