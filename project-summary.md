# Project Summary
At the end of every event, we like to pause and hear what goodness each project had. We do this with a **1 minute** summary given by each project lead.

Every project lead should collect a bit of data during the event about what was done. Hopefully all related issues were tagged with #goodnessSquad so that's also a way to know what was going on.

To assist in data collection, and to provide a general direction, here are the things worth mentioning.

## Things to mention

1. How many issues were resolved?
2. How many issues were created?
3. How many PR's were submitted?
4. How many PR's were merged?
5. Anything else you'd like to mention?
